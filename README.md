# DanzAI
"DanzAI" is a pioneering project designed to merge artificial intelligence (AI) technology with classical ballet practice, focusing on creating a detailed database of ballet-specific posture angles. This approach allows "DanzAI" to provide an accurate and useful tool to analyze and improve dancers' technique, facilitating more effective evaluation and correction of their practice. The collected database will be essential for future studies and applications of AI in dance, offering a valuable resource for dancers, teachers, and technology developers interested in exploring the intersection of art and artificial intelligence. By focusing on the precision of the angles of ballet postures, "DanzAI" seeks to elevate the quality of ballet teaching and performance, opening new avenues for research and innovation in the field of dance.
